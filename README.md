# Court-Reserve
One of the worst feelings in the world- making plans to play tennis with friends at your local tennis courts and showing up to find every single court occupied by players who have all "just started playing." Court Reserve is an Airbnb inspired web application that operates an online marketplace for booking tennis courts so that users will always be able to play when they want and where they want.
